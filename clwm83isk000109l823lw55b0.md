Hi there! My name is Fanny, and I am a software engineer specializing in web development. Over the years I have written PHP and Javascript mostly, however, I have never written any code in Python.

I want to share a bit about my journey into Python programming. If you're thinking about diving into programming or expanding your tech skills, I hope my story will inspire you to leap.

## The PyCon Uganda Spark

It all started in 2023 when I volunteered to help organize PyCon Uganda 2023. It was the first PyCon in Uganda an incredible experience, full of energy and enthusiasm from people passionate about Python.

The Python community is unlike any other—welcoming, supportive, and always ready to help.

Seeing people from different backgrounds come together to share their knowledge and love for Python was truly inspiring.

This experience lit a spark in me; I wanted to be part of this amazing community not just as an organizer but as a pythonista too.

## **Inspiration from DjangoCon Africa**

Attending DjangoCon Africa was another pivotal moment in my Python journey. This conference brought together amazing people from both the Python and Django communities.

We traveled from Uganda to Tanzania, Zanzibar. I met developers, educators, and enthusiasts who shared their stories and expertise, fueling my inspiration even further.

The collaborative spirit and innovative projects showcased at DjangoCon Africa were a testament to what can be achieved with Python and Django. Being a web developer, I knew I could try out these technologies too!

## Becoming a Pyladies Kampala Coach

A few months later, I was contacted to join Pyladies Kampala as a coach. This role was to help in organizing monthly Pyladies and design artwork for meetups.

I encountered numerous Python questions and problems that participants needed help with. While guiding others, I realized I wanted to deepen my understanding of Python.

![pyladies kampala needed help in organizing monthly events, i said yes](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1716647301226/ef177cbe-7cc7-45f8-a7d0-0df376888417.jpeg align="center")

Helping others is a fantastic way to learn, but it also made me aware of how much more there was for me to explore. So, I decided to dive headfirst into Python, not just to help others, but to grow my skills and knowledge.

## The Pull of AI

Another major reason I chose Python is my interest in artificial intelligence (AI). AI is revolutionizing the world, and Python is one of the best languages for anyone looking to get into AI.

Its simplicity and versatility make it an excellent choice for beginners and experts alike.

By learning Python, I knew I would be opening doors to countless possibilities in AI, from machine learning to data analysis. Python provides a solid foundation for anyone interested in exploring this exciting field.
